            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29698:4"/>him in the Pulpit, he uſed not to ſay to you, <hi>Come to me,</hi> to my opinion or party; but only, <hi>Come unto Chriſt that you may have life:</hi> He pleaded then for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and inſiſted upon the one thing neceſſary, having a latitude of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (though not an indifferency as to his own practice) for any parties of any perſwaſion, whom he ſaw walking in the path of <hi>Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone,</hi> and in <hi>paths of holineſs ſuted to that faith.</hi> He thought <hi>railing</hi> and <hi>ſmiting</hi> of little value to the ſoul, that neither hears the one, nor feels the other; and judge the <hi>Scottiſh Horning,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Significavit</hi> of equal value for the reformation of miſtakes in the underſtandings of Chriſtians. And that the rational ſoul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited its name that day, that it ſhould be thus conquered. This made him (though he could have wiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:29698:4"/>all as he was, excepting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy which men of his perſwaſion were ſubjected to, from thoſe who ſpeak evil of the things that they know not, yet in his preaching to purſue a nobler deſign, and to call you to come to him, who without reſpect of perſons receiveth men of all perſwaſions, (holding the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.) In him, he truſteth, he hath left many of your ſouls <hi>ſet upon the Rock that is higher than he is,</hi> having your faith not ſtanding in the <hi>wiſdom of men,</hi> but in the <hi>power of God, builded upon the foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief corner ſtone.</hi> He being now <hi>dead</hi> yet <hi>ſpeaketh,</hi> and ſpeaketh the ſame language, (after the beloved Apostle) <hi>abide in him.</hi> He deſires this of you, that if the <hi>way of worſhip</hi> wherein you (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him) formerly walked appear leſs according to the <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern

He aſſures you he would himſelf do it, and if in any thing he differs from you, this is the reaſon, He ſees, or thinks he ſees, what he embraceth moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God revealed in Scripture. He would in this point ſay more to you, if he did not think the holy Scriptures perfect as to a <hi>rule of Worſhip,</hi> and as able in that as in matter of Doctrine, to <hi>make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> and were not afraid of making himſelf wiſer than his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, one piece of whoſe errand to earth was to reveal his Fathers will. This hath made him repeat to you the Apoſtles words, <hi>Abide in him,</hi> thinking it the <hi>onely thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you,</hi> and a <hi>ſeaſonable
<pb facs="tcp:29698:5"/>word,</hi> whiles ſo many tempters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy you that happy ſtation.</p>
                  <p>As a means in order to this, he hath alſo fubjoyned ſomething to preſerve and quicken your appetite to <hi>Goſpel-inſtitutions.</hi> He knows that <hi>Union</hi> is maintained by <hi>Communion;</hi> and that <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with God is much in and by thoſe appointments of Worſhip which Chriſt hath inſtituted.

As <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſaid, <hi>What ſhould I do at Jeruſalem, if I may not ſee the Kings face.</hi> So ſaith a ſpiritual heart, what ſhall I do at a Prayer, at a Sermon, at a Sacrament, if I meet with nothing of God there. A gracious ſoul deſires an Ordinance, not as a man deſires a picture to pleaſe his ſenſe, but as he <hi>deſires</hi> a <hi>perſpective;</hi> that by the means of it he may ſee a Star, or the <hi>Moon,</hi> or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a far off. And this is a <hi>ſingularity;</hi> an hypocrite if he <hi>deſires</hi> to ſee the <hi>Vail,</hi> yet he deſires not to look through the Vail, what communion with God, in a prayer, in hearing the Word, in a Sacrament means, he underſtands not, and <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> He may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an Ordinance; as thinking his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance there, <hi>the road to Heaven,</hi> or the way to repute in the world, or a bit to ſtop the mouth of his Natural conſcience, barking for ſome ſhew of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29698:69"/>Religion; or as a pleaſant Song, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe in <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> 33.32. But what the preſence of God in the Ordinance meaneth, this he underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, nor doth he thirſt after it. Hence a Formaliſt, if he hath been at Church, is ſatisfied, let the Prayer and Preaching be what it will (provided it hath tickled his ſenſe) yet his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is ſtayed, and he wonders every one is not as content as he. The ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object of a gracious ſouls thirſt is not <hi>his Fathers Houſe,</hi> but his <hi>Fathers face</hi> in his Houſe. If he hath not ſeen that he comes away <hi>a-thirſt</hi> from the <hi>beſt wells.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>In the mediate object.</hi> The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate object is the <hi>performance.</hi> An Hypocrite if he hath any deſire to an Ordinance, yet he is very careleſs, as to the rites, and manner of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. It is not thus with a gracious ſoul. The reaſon lyes partly in what I ſaid before, that the ultimate object of his thirſt is <hi>God:</hi> the preſence of God in an Ordinance: he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this can be expected, where God is not ſanctified in the duty by a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29698:69"/>regular performance of it, and a ſtrict obſervation of the rule, as to it, which God himſelf hath preſcribed: he knows that in matters of Worſhip, God is more eminently jealous; that of all ſins, none ſo provoke God, none ſo ſoon ſeparate him from a people as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in matter of Worſhip. This makes his regulare appetite languid, and weak as to religious performances, where God hath indeed appointed the thing in the general, but man only hath preſumed to direct the manner, for which alſo was ſufficient direction in Gods word. His thirſt is after peace, and unmixed Ordinances.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>As to the End:</hi> The gracious heart deſires the ſincere milk of the word, that he may grow thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> that he may profit by it; he thirſts after publick prayer, that he might pour out his ſoul before God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an anſwer of peace; he thirſts after a Sacrament, that in it he may have a communion with Chriſt, that he might in it receive the communications of the vertue of the blood of Chriſt to his ſoul, further ſtrengthning, quickning, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29698:70"/>him. The hypocritical formaliſt thirſts after theſe things, only that he might ſtop the mouth of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or that he might appear to men to have ſomething of Religion, or for ſome ſuch low and unworthy end. Thus the thirſt of a gracious heart hath a ſingularity in it, as to the object and end.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It is ſingular as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and ſtrength of it. As the hart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the water-brooks,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. A formaliſt thus never thirſteth, he hath never ſuch an appetite to an Ordinance, but he can either attend it or let it alone. When he is hotteſt, tell him of a <hi>Play,</hi> or a <hi>Market,</hi> and he can turn aſide out of the Church-path thither: if he be ſeen at a Sermon, or a Prayer, 'tis rather out of wantonneſs than appetite: hence a little thing turns him aſide, and a little ſerves his turn; four hours at a Comedy is too little, one at a Sermon, half of one in a Prayer, is too much. If he hath not a Sermon at his door, he is not thirſty enough to go a mile to hear one. The gracious ſoul goes from City to City,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29698:70"/>from ſtrength to ſtrength, paſſeth through Cities, and ſtreets, and broad places. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.20.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The thirſt of a gracious ſoul is ſingular in the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of it, and its <hi>inſatiableneſs. Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>My ſoul break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the longing it hath to thy judgments at all times.</hi> A formaliſt hath his fits of thirſt, but they are but at ſome times, when the good mood comes upon him; and he is quickly ſatisfied, quickly cloied. A gracious heart may have a greater thirſt upon him at ſome times than at others, but the edge is never off his ſpiritual appetite, nor is he ever ſatisfied; he could (as to his ſpirit) his fleſh indeed is weak) be always hearing lively and powerful Sermons, always praying; he is troubled to ſee the Glaſs ſo ſoon out, and the ſhadows of the evening ſo ſoon ſtretched upon the Lords days, and cries out to God, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are always before thee.</hi> He bleſſeth the Sparrows and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29698:71"/>that can make neſts at the Lords Altars.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In fine, there is a ſingularity in this. The <hi>thirſt</hi> of gracious ſouls is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> the thirſt of other ſouls is <hi>diſſembled</hi> and <hi>carnal.</hi> An unregenerate man, whether profane and carnal, or formal and moral, may prefend a thirſt after divine inſtitutions, but he doth but pretend. What a ſtir did the generality of theſe make for Sacraments, when they have them with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they deſired, how little do they come at them? What longing did they pretend formerly to ſome forms of Devotion, which now they enjoy, how ſeldom are they at? how ſlightly do they attend? And as their thirſt is pretended more than real, ſo it is <hi>carnal</hi> wherein it is real. There is a carnal part in <hi>Divine inſtitutions.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us the Jews had <hi>carnal ordinances</hi> impoſed on them;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> he ſaith they were but <hi>until the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> i. e. until the <hi>Goſpel times.</hi> Such was their <hi>Muſick,</hi> their <hi>Levitical gay garments,</hi> their <hi>ceremonial rites,</hi> their <hi>worldly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnary,</hi> which had the <hi>golden cenſer,</hi> the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29698:71"/>
                        <hi>golden pot that had Manna,</hi> &amp;c. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions as pleaſed the outward ſenſes, but did not inwardly affect the heart, nor had much influence upon that. In oppoſition to theſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 4.24. we are commanded to worſhip God in <hi>ſpirit and truth.</hi> Under the Goſpel there is a <hi>carnal part</hi> alſo in <hi>Ordinances.</hi> In <hi>Prayer,</hi> in <hi>Preaching,</hi> the wit and neat compoſure or pronunciation of the Prayer or Sermon, they are but the carnal part. Now take an unſanctified heart, if it hath any thirſt after any thing that hath the name, or looketh like a Divine inſtitution, 'tis after the carnal part. You will ſee their copy, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.32. <hi>And lo thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument.</hi> Hence they mock at a Prayer that is not dreſſed up in fine language, and mock at Sermous that are not full of Sentences of Authors, pieces of wit, quibbles, and ſuch like vanities, which (to uſe the term in the Prophet) are but like the <hi>ſouls bread mixed up with mans dung,</hi> which makes the gracious ſoul nauſeate it.

                     <p>In the next place therefore,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> let us take an hint from hence to try whether the true <hi>Spirit of Chriſtians breatheth in us</hi> yea or no. <hi>Grande eſt Chriſtianum eſſe non dici.</hi> It is a ſmall thing to be called Chriſtians, it is a great thing to be a Chriſtian indeed. If thou beeſt ſo, thy ſoul will thirſt after the inſtitutions of God. As a new-born babe thou wilt deſire the milk of the Word, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29698:79"/>thou maiſt grow thereby. And that thou maiſt not deceive thy ſelf, conſider what thou haſt heard.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thy thirſt will be <hi>after God in the Ordinance. For thee, for the living God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> If thy thirſt be ſuch as can be allaied without any thing of God, I mean, any influence of God upon thy ſoul through the conduit of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it is no more than a formal hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may have. What ſayeſt thou, Chriſtian? Is this the temper of thy ſoul? Thou longeſt for an hour of prayer, to hear a good Sermon, and when thou haſt had thy deſire, art thou unſatisfied ſtill, unleſs thou haſt found God coming into thy ſoul in Prayer, and ſpeaking to thee in the Sermon, this ſpeaks a Chriſtian indeed, if any thing leſs than this will ſatisfie thee, thou wilt fetch nothing of evidence from it, it is no more than hypocrites may do, who take theſe attendances for their righteouſneſs, and have a kind of thirſt to them, that they may have ſomething to glory in before God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Thy thirſt</hi> (ſecondly) <hi>will be after divine inſtitutions in their pureſt and moſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29698:79"/>powerful adminiſtrations.</hi> The end of a Chriſtian in waiting upon God in holy inſtitutions, being partly that he might <hi>pay an homage to God, i. e.</hi> do what God hath required of him as his duty, and partly that in them <hi>he may meet with God,</hi> and find his preſence and power. His thirſt muſt neceſſarily be thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, for he argueth thus with himſelf, Hath God any where preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me this ſervice or mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? If not, how can I think to pleaſe or do homage to him by an action which he never required of me, nor did it ever come into his heart to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me any ſuch thing? Again, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I deſire Ordinances, but that in them I may ſee the <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God? Can I expect either the <hi>preſence</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of God in humane iffventions? And as his thirſt is after the moſt pure, ſo it is after the moſt <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> adminiſtrations; after ſuch praying where the heart is moſt melted, and poured out like water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. Such preaching, where the Preacher comes cloſeſt to the ſoul, and does not play off in generals only,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29698:80"/>as if he were afraid to touch the ſores of ſouls, or to tell people of their ſins. For a judicious Chriſtian, though he knows the efficacy of the Ordinance, doth not depend upon the purity or ability of the Adminiſtrator; yet he alſo knows, that in this period of time God uſeth not to work miracles, but to concur with probable means, means that have ſome rational tendency to the end; and ſuitably he obſerveth, that God in the diſpenſation of his grace, ordinarily co-operates with ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as live their Doctrine, and ſpeak <hi>the Oracles of God</hi> as the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> with <hi>plainneſs, gravity, life</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> He knows the end of preaching is not ſcratching a peeviſh humour, nor tickling the ear, but affecting and changing the heart.<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.1.</note>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29698:110"/>This was doubtleſs the cauſe of the great diſappointment in the year 1666. the things people looked for in that year ſhall moſt undoubtedly have a being, and be in their ſeaſon brought to paſs: <hi>The Jews ſhall be called, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be deſtroyed, the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in, and</hi> (it is more than probable) <hi>that the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God before the end of the world ſhall have a year of Jubilee.</hi> Now many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, too too haſty and curious in ſearch of ſecret things, deſiring as the Diſciples to know <hi>when theſe things ſhould be;</hi> They ſearch the Scripture, and finding a dark ſentence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18. that the <hi>number of the beaſt was</hi> 666, conclude the year 1666 the particular year when God would at leaſt begin to do theſe things.</item>
                        <item>2. A ſecond <hi>error</hi> may be as to the <hi>circumſtance of place.</hi> It is hard to fix promiſes to particular places.

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:29698:111"/>1. <hi>No great expectations can be builded upon profane perſons.</hi> I do not ſay, no great things for the good of Gods people may be done by them. I know <hi>Cyrus</hi> was Gods <hi>ſervant,</hi> to proclaim liberty to the Jews: and oft-times God hath made the <hi>wrath of men to praiſe him. Pharaoh</hi> ſhall keep the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> alive, and provide for them in a time of famine.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay, expectations cannot be raiſed on theſe foundations: If the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> doth Gods work, <hi>howbeit he meaneth not ſo,</hi> ſaith God. As the wife Faulkener maketh uſe of the ravenous quality of the Hawk to ſerve his turn, and make it get that for him which the Bird gat for it ſelf; ſo the wiſe God will make uſe of an <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> an <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian,</hi> a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> an utter enemy to his people, and make his ſelfiſh politick deſigns to ſerve his everlaſting purpoſe; but here is no ground for Gods people to build expectations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nay, ſecondly, <hi>Be the perſons never ſo holy that appear to us probable to do us good,</hi> no certain expectation can be raiſed upon them. Who would have

So that to build ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations upon any particular perſons, is to lay a foundation for our diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt errour may be as to <hi>particular means.</hi> It is true, God doth moſt of his works by <hi>means,</hi> but he wonderfully varies in the nature and kind of means he uſeth: ſometimes he doth it by what we call <hi>fair means;</hi> ſometimes by force, and what we call <hi>foul means.</hi> The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be delivered our of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the ruine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That's a good Chriſtian that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29698:118"/>ſtedfaſtly believeth the matter of the Promiſe, and patiently waiteth upon God for the fulfilling of it till his good time come. It is a ſad effect that ſome mens giddy confidence upon the year 1666 hath produced.

The Nation (of which they are a ſmall part) may have ſinned to ſuch a heighth. Indeed were we never ſo certain, yet our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſhould not hinder prayer: Holy <hi>Daniel</hi> taught us this, he never prayed more heartily than when <hi>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by books</hi> that the time of the

                        <item>6. <hi>Expect not much in a courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</hi> The reaſon of this lies in Gods uſual deliverances of his people, which have been upon the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities; Out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> when one would have thought there had been leaſt likelihood.

                        <item>7.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29698:120"/>to the promiſe; if it be not, it hath no foundation to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and can have no certainty. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in all promiſes of this natures the judgment of the <hi>particular good,</hi> whether under <hi>preſent circumſtances</hi> it be ſo or no, belongs unto God. Expect deliverance from evils of this nature, and the collation of good of this nature, if God in his wiſdom ſeeth it good for thee, or that part of his Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou art.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E being Miniſters of the Goſpel, who have formerly received a charge of ſome of your ſouls, knowing how great the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of Gods glory in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, and the propagation of it in the power thereof is; and having obſerved ſome decays thereof in preſent Profeſſors, from the life, zeal, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29698:122"/>power thereof in our fore-fathers: and withall how many temptations are daily offered to the corruption which yet remaineth in the beſt, to divert them from the ſtreight and narrow way which leadeth to the Kingdom of God. That through our negligence, the ſtudy and powerful practice of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs (wherein <hi>England</hi> hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous above any other ſort of Chriſtian people) may not abate, and Religion evaporate into a meer formality; and the ſouls of you, our Brethren, might not be hindred of that joy and peace which uſually attendeth a ſtrict and cloſe walking with God, have thought fit to propoſe our ſerious thoughts unto you, for the revival and preſervation of Religion, wherein we ſhall rather give you a copy of the converſation of our fathers, who walked with God in their generation, than propound any new thing unto you.</p>
                  <p>There are three things in Religion obſerved as the glory of <hi>England,</hi> wherein our Church hath exceeded other Reformed Churches.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The diligent practice of Family-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>

                     <item>3. <hi>The ſevere perſonal ſtrictneſs in the Converſation of Profeſſors.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And as theſe things have been the the beauty of <hi>England,</hi> ſo we doubt not but they have been the ſtrength of it.</p>
                  <p>We therefore as Miniſters of Chriſt do beſeech you (and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by how much our condition in reſpect of publick communion is more ſad than in former times) that you would joyn with us in your particular places, ſo much as in you lies, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto God an <hi>England,</hi> that antient <hi>Revenue of his glory,</hi> which he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had from our fathers in theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you is the promoving of <hi>Family Religion,</hi> and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>week-day,</hi> and to the <hi>Lords day. Families</hi> are the loweſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and ſuch wherein we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantages to propagate Religion, than in any others, and that not only in reſpect of our daily converſe in them, but of the authority with which God hath
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29698:123"/>there cloathed ſuperiours. They are the <hi>Societies</hi> in which alone eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private perſon (who is the Head of the family) is a <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> And <hi>he that cannot rule his own houſe well,</hi> is by the Apoſtle determined unfit to <hi>rule the Church of God.</hi> In order to which we propound,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every one who is Head of a family would <hi>by a conſtant deportment to his or her children or ſervants, vindicate the honour which God in the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment hath reſerved for him;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by too much familiarity, diveſting himſelf of his authority; nor by too much ſeverity, eſtranging the hearts of his Relations from him; but by a wiſe gravity ſo deporting himſelf, that while his relations <hi>fear him,</hi> as being in the ſtead of God unto them: they may alſo <hi>love him</hi> for his tenderneſs to them, both in their <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> concernments. In order to which we deſire Chriſtians to conſider, <hi>That he or ſhe is rarely diſhonoured by his child or ſervant, who have not by too low and unhandſome carriage diſhonoured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before them;</hi> God ordinarily vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29698:123"/>the honour of ſuperiours, till themſelves have unduly proſtituted it; that they may read their ſin in their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That being cloathed with this authority from God, <hi>you would make it your buſineſs to vindicate his glory,</hi> not enduring any in your families, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due <hi>admonition,</hi> and the uſe of other means to reclaim him or her, ſhall live in the practice of any <hi>moral vice,</hi> or what ſhall have an evident appearance of it. If any therefore in your families ſhall be given to <hi>drinking, ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prophaning the holy Name of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling of his people,</hi> any <hi>ſpecies of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or any <hi>other ſcandalous ſin,</hi> (if they be ſuch as you can turn away) if they will not be reclaimed, remember the reſolution of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101.6, 7. If they be ſuch as either by <hi>natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> or <hi>moral contract</hi> you are obliged to keep, let it be your buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all poſſible ways, by <hi>inſtruction, admonition, correction,</hi> begging the help of others to reclaim them, that their ſins may not be laid to your charge. Conſider with what face he can blame
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29698:124"/>the Magiſtrate for not puniſhing theſe offences, who neglecteth it in his own family, where the body to be ruled is leſs, and his authority, as to ſome kind of puniſhment, far greater than the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates is. And as a means in order to this we deſire,</p>
                  <p>That giving your children and ſervants all due liberty of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially with ſuch company as you ſhall commend to them, <hi>you would reſtrain them, as much as may be, from Plays, Fairs, Meetings for Dances and others Revels,</hi> and from Recreation at undue hours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſeeing <hi>an ability to read the Scriptures,</hi> and other good Books, is the foundation of all knowledge, you would not only ſee <hi>to the bringing up your children to this capacity;</hi> but if the providence of God caſts any under your roof that cannot read, <hi>you would exhort, encourage, and by all means help them till they attain this faculty.</hi> What knoweth the Maſter, but he may thus be a means to ſave the ſoul of his ſervant, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the knowledge of God? We urge this rather, becauſe we obſerve
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29698:124"/>divers well diſpoſed perſons grown up, miſerably diſadvantaged for the want of this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The family being thus ordered and diſpoſed, <hi>is prepared for a joint com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</hi> And ſurely, if there were no Scriptures evincing <hi>Worſhip,</hi> a family-duty, ſuch as that of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> reſolving <hi>with his houſe</hi> to ſerve the Lord. <hi>Cornelius, fearing God with his whole houſe,</hi> and praying there <hi>about the ninth hour of the day. Davids walking in his houſe in a perfect way. Abrahams inſtructing his houſhold.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s imprecation upon the <hi>families which call not on the name of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>mutual prayers of husband and wife,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> which the Apoſtle hinteth that he would not have hindred. <hi>Daniels</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his houſe thrice a day, (which we cannot tell how it ſhould have been proved againſt him, had he done it alone.) We ſay, that were there none of theſe evidences from holy Writ, yet every Chriſtians reaſon can tell him, that the providence of God hath caſt us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to family ſocieties, not meerly for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and civil ends, but for to be joynt

                  <p>We know no act of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but may be performed in ſo ſmall a ſociety as that of a family, if a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained Miniſter be the Head of it, or aſſumed, into it for that time. But we ſhall only ſpeak to thoſe duties which God expecteth of every family, without any reſpect to a Miniſter in it, &amp;c. Thoſe we conceive are reducible to four heads.</p>

Only commending them as duties fit to be ſometimes done, and not wholly omitted by any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having thus far offered you our thoughts for the <hi>Family-Worſhip</hi> of <hi>every day;</hi> We come in the next place, to commend to you the <hi>ſpecial ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lords day:</hi> where we ſhall not ſpeak to the more <hi>publick ſolemn
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29698:129"/>ſanctification</hi> of it, but keep our ſelves within the bounds of the private houſe.</p>
                  <p>We know our Brethren underſtand, that by the fourth Commandment God hath reſerved a ſeventh part of our Time to himſelf: That what ſhould be the ſeventh part, under the old diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant to the Jews, was determined by God to be the ſeventh day from the Creation: That our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part is determined by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles, who were wont to meet and ſanctie the firſt day of the Week, counting the ſeventh from our <hi>redemption,</hi> when the world was as it was created anew.</p>
                  <p>That we are tied to the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this day by the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, none can doubt; but he muſt queſtion whether there be ten Commandments, or no; or whether the fourth be a Moral Law. Nor can any ſound reaſon be given, why the fourth Commandment ſhould not concern Chriſtians, as much as any of the other nine.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is plain, that it muſt be
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29698:129"/>kept as a <hi>day of holy reſt from labour and recreations,</hi> at other times lawful: and <hi>to ſpiritual ſervices publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe being the confeſſed general duties of Chriſtians, as to the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Sabbath, we ſhall only offer ſome Propoſitions for particular practice, in reference to theſe general ends.</p>

                     <item>6. We commend to our brethren, as part of their family duty, that morning <hi>to inſtruct their families in the Nature of Worſhip, the ſeveral acts of it. The true manner, both of the outward and inward performance. The morality of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:29698:130"/>the true way of ſanctifying of it.</hi> To which purpoſe we recommend to them Mr. <hi>Sheppards Treatiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> clearing the morality, and Mr. <hi>Bernards threefold Treatiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>

We deſire that our Brethren would not omit it, at leaſt to do it once every Lords Day.</item>
                     <item>8. Finally, We beſeech our Brethren, <hi>that they take eſpecial care of all within their gates on the Lords Day;</hi> that they profane not the Sabbath by unneceſſary work, ſleep, or recreations.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That they do not give holy things to

                  <p>Theſe things (our dearly beloved Brethren) are all which at preſent we ſhall commend to you. The nature, and reaſonableneſs of them is ſuch as we are aſſured they have an evidence to all your conſciences, either as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or highly uſeful, only as we are prone to make excuſes in any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and eſpecially where the revival of it may ſeem to condemn our former
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29698:133"/>neglect; ſo we are afraid leaſt (as to that part which relates to the order and worſhip of families) we ſhould hear ſome excuſing themſelves. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                        <item>1. <hi>From want of time:</hi> or,</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>From want of fit matter in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:</hi> or,</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>From want of parts and abilities;</hi> or,</item>

                  <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, we know there is a great difference of men as to leiſure, and therefore (as we ſaid before) we believe more of this nature is required from a <hi>Daniel,</hi> or a <hi>David,</hi> than from a private perſon: but,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This cannot be pleaded as to <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Dayes Service.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be pleaded as to <hi>Morning duties,</hi> there the time may, and ought if need be, be redeemed from ſleep.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So that all the diſpute is about one half hour at night: and we leave it to every Chriſtian that is ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and conſcientious to think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this plea will not argue a greater
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29698:134"/>want of a good heart. Beſides if this duty be neceſſary, we hope that our brethren, who, let their trade and buſineſs be what it will, will find a time to dine and ſup, becauſe they are naturally neceſſary; will alſo find a time for theſe duties which are ſpiritually neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to thoſe who complain that <hi>their families neither do, nor can conſiſt of fit matter for theſe duties.</hi> It only reacheth to <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and that too on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to ſervants; for ſurely Parents can command their children. As to them we ſay, <hi>Servants</hi> are either <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,</hi> or <hi>hired by the year,</hi> or <hi>by the day;</hi> for the latter ſort, they are not properly members of our families. For the former, doubtleſs, Maſters have a great power over them; and though if they be ſtubborn, they cannot direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force them to this, yet they may keep them to ſuch a ſtrictneſs in labour, that they will be glad to purchaſe ſome relaxation there by a complying in this with the deſires and endeavours of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for the good of their ſouls. For <hi>yearly ſervants,</hi> it is true they are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29698:134"/>but tranſient members of our family, but for their hired time, Governours have the ſame power over them, as over Apprentices; and there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but better may be provided, if they will not comply. Beſides, <hi>Servants</hi> that ſhall thus refuſe, muſt be 1. Either ſuch as have ſome particular different <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> in religion, who it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand much of the Principles of Religion: or, 2. Such <hi>ſtubborn refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns,</hi> as will be kept under no better Civil Government than Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo unfit to be continued in our houſes. But we are verily perſwaded that they are very few, who by fair and gentle treating with them might not be brought to this order: however, as to children the duties may proceed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For thoſe who complain <hi>for want of parts</hi> to diſcharge this work: The plea only holds as to <hi>prayer,</hi> and ſet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes on Scripture. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commend to Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>no heads of families be patient till they have learned to read,</hi> the want of this being a moſt inexcuſable ſin in theſe dayes, wherein are ſo many means for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:29698:135"/>2. <hi>That as many as poſſible would learn to write, and practice writing;</hi> and as many as can would learn to write Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, writing by Characters being of infinite uſe in this work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Though we cannot commend Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tying themſelves to forms of prayers</hi> made by others; Yet rather than not pray at all, that Chriſtians would read a Prayer Morning and Evening to their families out of ſome good Book, ſuch as the <hi>Practice of Piety, &amp;c.</hi> at leaſt at firſt ſetting up ſuch a <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That no Chriſtian would reſt here,</hi> but being aſſured, that the <hi>gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is attainable by any Chriſtian,</hi> that will take pains, that they would uſe all means to attain unto it, and to that end, we ſhall not only be ready our ſelves to give ſuch as come to us Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; but we earneſtly commend unto them, the reading and ſtudy of Dr. <hi>Wilkin's</hi> Book <hi>concerning the gift of prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to <hi>opening the Scriptures, and from them ſpeaking to people.</hi> Though we could wiſh that as many as have time and leiſure, would apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:29698:135"/>to get ſuch knowledge as might enable themſelves by ſtudy to find out the ſenſe of a Text. Yet in regard that all cannot do that, we have before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our Brethren ſome ſuch Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Books, as may in this be helpful to them: And in regard every one hath not an ability to purchaſe ſuch Books, we ſhall only offer it to our Brethren; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther four or five might not joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in buying ſuch an Engliſh Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as they ſhall be adviſed to, each ſharing in it, that ſo the whole number may be amongſt them all, and ready to be mutually Aent: and if they pleaſe, they may ſo agree, as when any one dyeth, the others may purchaſe his ſhare at a certain rate.</p>
                  <p>The moſt of theſe things Brethren (eſpecially which concern the Worſhip of God in their families, and the private Sanctification of the Sabbath) though we believe them to be in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the practice of many of you, and from your Parents you have been inſtructed in the practice of them: yet conſidering the great moment the reviving of Religion in families is of,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:29698:136"/>at ſuch a time as this, and the great neglect in many families, occaſioned poſſibly, for that ſome had not ſuch good examples, in the families of their education, we have thought good to uſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> expreſſion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>To ſtir up your minds by way of remembrance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we conceive God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, our own ſouls, and the ſouls of all under our charges highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged, Religion would be revived, preſerved and propagated, and much of the glory of the Profeſſors of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> recovered; and the Adverſaries of Religion and Godlineſs would gnaſh their teeth, to ſee every family become a Church, and the Nurſery of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and lively practice of Godlineſs, which by ſo much profane ſcoffing, they endeavour to diſcourage, and by ſo much activity they labour wholly to extirpate.</p>
